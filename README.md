Ascension
=========

A JavaScript canvas game after the Ascension deckbuilding game. http://ascensiongame.com/

Note: I was unable to obtain permission from Stoneblade Entertainment to use their intellectual property for this project.
As such, I will discontinue development on this project (even though I just started). I will think about writing some other card games instead.
They have an online version of Ascension being released through their kickstarter project here. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1965800643/ascension-online
